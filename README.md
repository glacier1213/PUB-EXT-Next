This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and enhanced with the Government of Canada's Web Experience Toolkit (WET) and Centrally Deployed Template Solution (CDTS) using the `@arcnovus/wet-boew-react` library, it also features bilingual support via [next-i18next](https://github.com/isaachinman/next-i18next).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ⚠️ Gotchas

### Links

Use standard `<a>` tags for links, instead of the NextJS `<Link>` component.
Standard `<a>` tags will use the Next router automatically by virtue of the
`linkHandler` property passed to the `<WetTemplate>` component.
This ensures that `<a>` tags generated by WET will behave correctly.
